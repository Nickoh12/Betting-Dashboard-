# Betting Dashboard

In this project, I wrote a program that srapes sports betting odds from various odds-comparison websites and stores them in a MySql Database. 
Relying only on the odds, I build a dashboard on shiny that displays mispriced odds in the market, allowing me to seek profit. 

Here's what the dashboard currently looks like.
